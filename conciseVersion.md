- 65,000+ farmers across multiple countries
- Missed financial engagement opportunities

## Slide 4: Project Goals
- **Automate:** Rule-based communication triggers
- **Engage:** 30% increase in platform usage
- **Deliver:** Multi-channel notifications
- **Facilitate:** Financial action prompts
- **Measure:** Communication effectiveness

## Slide 5: Proposed Solution
- **Hybrid Architecture:** FastAPI + Apache Airflow
- **Event-Driven System:** Real-time Kafka processing
- **Rule-Based Triggers:** Contextual communications
- **Multi-Channel Delivery:** SMS, email, in-app
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Performance metrics

## Slide 6: Current Progress
- Requirements analysis completed
- Technical architecture finalized
- Development environment configured
- Core FastAPI service implemented
- User activity tracking models developed
- Inactivity detection proof-of-concept created
- Integration approach established

## Slide 7: Technical Architecture
[Architecture diagram]
- **Front-End:** MyCoop and VSLA interfaces
- **Orchestration:** FastAPI + Airflow hybrid
- **Integration:** Kafka consumers, REST clients
- **Notification:** Multi-channel delivery system
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana

## Slide 8: Implementation Approach
**Phase 1:** Core Infrastructure (Complete)
- Development environment, database, API foundations

**Phase 2:** Business Logic (In Progress)
- Key triggers, templates, user segmentation

**Phase 3:** System Integration (Upcoming)
- Service connections, testing, deployment

## Slide 9: Challenges & Mitigation
| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Integration Complexity | Mock services, phased approach |
| Real-Time Performance | Queue-based architecture |
| Multi-Language Support | Template-based localization |
| Timeline Pressure | MoSCoW prioritization |

## Slide 10: Timeline & Next Steps
